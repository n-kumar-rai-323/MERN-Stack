// In ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), inline functions are typically associated with arrow functions,
//  which offer a concise and modern way to define functions directly in the context where 
//  they are used. Arrow functions inherently simplify the syntax for inline functions and 
//  are widely used for callbacks, one-liners, and anonymous function expressions.
