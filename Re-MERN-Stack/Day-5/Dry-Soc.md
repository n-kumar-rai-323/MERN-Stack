DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Definition:
The DRY principle emphasizes that every piece of knowledge or logic in a software system should have a single, unambiguous representation. In simpler terms, it means that you should avoid duplicating code or logic across your application.

Goals:
Reduce Redundancy: By avoiding duplicate code, you minimize the chances of errors. If you need to make a change, you only have to do it in one place.
Enhance Maintainability: Maintaining code becomes easier when you have a single source of truth. If a bug is found in a piece of duplicated logic, you only need to fix it once.
Improve Readability: Code is easier to read and understand when it is not cluttered with repeated sections.
Examples of DRY:
Function Reuse: Instead of copying the same code in multiple places, you can create a function and call it whenever needed.

javascript
Copy code
// Not DRY: Code duplication
const area1 = length * width;
const area2 = length * width;

// DRY: Using a function
function calculateArea(length, width) {
    return length * width;
}

const area1 = calculateArea(length, width);
const area2 = calculateArea(length, width);
Database Normalization: In database design, normalizing tables to eliminate redundancy is an application of the DRY principle.

SoC (Separation of Concerns)
Definition:
Separation of Concerns is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern or functionality. This means organizing your code so that different functionalities are divided into different modules or layers.

Goals:
Modularity: Each module or component should handle a specific responsibility. This makes it easier to develop, test, and maintain each part of the application.
Reusability: By separating concerns, you can reuse modules across different parts of the application or even in different applications.
Easier Testing: Isolated components can be tested independently, making it simpler to identify and fix issues.
Improved Collaboration: Different team members can work on different concerns simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.
Examples of SoC:
MVC Architecture: The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a classic example of SoC. It separates an application into three main components:

Model: Represents the data and business logic.
View: Handles the user interface and presentation.
Controller: Manages user input and interacts with the model to update the view.
Layered Architecture: In a web application, you can separate concerns by having distinct layers for data access, business logic, and presentation, like:

Data Layer: Interacts with the database.
Business Logic Layer: Contains the application logic.
Presentation Layer: Manages the user interface.
Summary
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) helps avoid code duplication, making code easier to maintain and understand.
SoC (Separation of Concerns) organizes code into distinct modules or layers, each responsible for a specific aspect of functionality, promoting modularity, reusability, and easier testing.
